# Family Doctor Practice Website

A modern, responsive single-page website for a family doctor's practice. The website features sections for services, pricing, and contact information.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Modern and clean UI
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Contact form
- Service highlights
- Pricing information
- Contact details and working hours

## Customization

To customize the website for your practice:

1. Update the doctor's name in `index.html` (replace "Dr. Smith's Practice")
2. Modify the services and pricing information in `index.html`
3. Update the contact information (address, phone, email)
4. Change the background image in `styles.css` (currently using a placeholder from Unsplash)
5. Adjust the color scheme in `styles.css` if desired (main colors are defined in the CSS variables)

## How to Use

1. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website
2. For deployment, upload all files to your web hosting service
3. The contact form currently shows an alert message - you'll need to add server-side code to handle form submissions
