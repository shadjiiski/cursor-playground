The soft hum of your ship's engines fills the bridge as you review the latest trade route data. Your cargo hold is full of valuable medical supplies bound for Earth - a shipment that could save thousands of lives in the ongoing pandemic.\n\nYour crew consists of:\n- Commander Rodriguez, your first officer and tactical specialist\n- Lieutenant James, communications officer and former Federation intelligence operative\n- Chief Engineer Martinez, a brilliant but eccentric engineer who keeps your ship running\n- Dr. Patel, your medical officer and expert in xenobiology\n- ALEX, your ship's advanced AI system\n- Security Team Alpha, led by Sergeant O'Connor, a veteran of the Federation Marine Corps\n\nSuddenly, your communications officer, Lieutenant James, calls out, 'Captain, we're receiving a distress signal!' The message crackles through the speakers, fragmented and desperate: '...Titan-7... under attack... pirates... children... help...' before cutting off into static.\n\nYour first officer, Commander Rodriguez, looks up from the tactical display. 'The signal's weak, but it's definitely from the mining colony. They've been having trouble with the Black Nebula Pirates for months.'\n\nYour ship's AI, ALEX, chimes in: 'Captain, I've analyzed the transmission. The colony's reactor is showing signs of instability. If we don't act soon, there could be a catastrophic failure.'",
